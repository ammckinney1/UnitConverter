Stuff to do:

POTENTIAL IDEAS: (For those who don't know what they can work on)
http://www.unitconverters.net/  (Check this site out)
Add more conversions in general. 

Things to do other than build and fill tables:
1. Conversion checking. We need someone to go through each possiblitity on each side and check to see if the numbers are correct.
2. Attempt to break the application (make sure we have caught and handled every possible exception)

Conversions we could add/modify: (All of these are avaiable through google calc)
1. Area
2. Data Transfer Rate (Bits per second to Kilobits per second)
3. Digital Storage (byte to kilobyte) - "DAVGOR"
4. Energy (Joules to Kilowatt Hour)
5. Sound Frequencies
6. Fuel Mileage
7. Mass (Pound to Ounce)
8. Angles (Sin Cos Tan) (This might require extra work)
9. Pressure
10. Speed - Matthew Rozendaal (Hydrplane72)
11. Temperature (This might be the easiest of them all)
12. Time - "DAVGOR"
13. Volume

Good Job everyone so far, this has come along quite well. I think all thats really left is busy work ie. building and filling new tables, testing each conversion, and refining the gui. I believe we can really get this project finished by the end of the semester.
